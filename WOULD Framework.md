#projectPlanning #WOULD 

## W
- walk through the project
- what is the project going to look like
- the happy path (if everything goes well)
- big picture

## O
- open the requirements
- when ever you are given requirements on a project the are not complete
- what are the **TRUE** requirements
- question yourself "What are you missing?"
- if you dont know **ASK**
- "What platform does it need to run on?"
- "Will it in the future?"


## U
- User interface design
- How its going to look
- Use what you wanna use but make sure it's moderately fast
- this process is suppose to be quick and painless (because of sunk cost fallacy)
- redrafts happen often
- Look back at requirements (make sure the design can meet the requirements)


## L
- Logic design
- big picture
- what does the app need (database, connection to other things)
- how the user goes through from start to finish
- Use the user interface design and pretend you are a user
- User flow is important (need to be intuitive)


## D
- Data design
- How to structure the data you are getting
