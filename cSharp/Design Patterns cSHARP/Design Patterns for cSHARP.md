![[Different types of design patterns.png]]

**Creational Design Pattern:** As the name suggests, this design provide mechanisms of various object creation with reuse of existing code and increases flexibility.

**Structural Design Patterns:** As the name suggests, this pattern help us to create and implement the flexible and efficient structures and how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures.

**Behavioral Design Patterns:** As the name suggests, object behavior and responsibilities between objects are very important and this design patterns are concerned with algorithms as well.

## when to apply
- Take the design as a reference and check does the design pattern really work as expected, if yes then only use that pattern. If no find another pattern.
- The most important part of applying patterns to your codebase is knowing when and where to apply each pattern.
- If you are implementing just for the sake of having a pattern, you will probably do more damage to your project.
